"----------------Detailed summary for each FDR level----------------------"
"Per level for each group following information are provided:"
Input, "Number of matches that where considered as input (e.g. the total PSM or the number peptide pairs that passed the PSM-level FDR)"
Input TT, "Number of target target matches (or just target in case of linear matches)"
Input TD, "Number of target decoy matches - independent of order (or just decoy in case of linear matches)"
Input DD, "Number of decoy decoy matches"
passing FDR, "Number of matches passing the FDR (on this level - final number can be smaller do to higher level filter)"
"FDR TT", "Number of target target matches passing the level FDR - disregarding higher level FDR filter"
"FDR TD", "Number of target decoy matches passing the level FDR - disregarding higher level FDR filter"
"FDR DD", "Number of decoy decoy matches passing the level FDR - disregarding higher level FDR filter"
"lower FDR", "The next FDR < target FDR, that could be calculated (to give an idea of the precision of the FDR calculation)"
"higher FDR", "The next FDR > targetFDR, that could be calculated (to give an idea of the precision of the FDR calculation)"
"final", "The number of matches passing this *AND* the higher level FDR filter"
